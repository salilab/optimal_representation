## binary_complexes
Each sample binary complex contains the folders `rstar` and `rprime` for results of optimal representation and approximately 
optimal (efficiently computed) representation respectively. Additional folders for example 2IDO (`sparse` and `dense` for results of optimization in the 
presence of sparse and dense crosslinks) and 7CEI (`structure` for results of optimization in the 
presence of subunit structure) are present. \

Each folder contains one subfolder for each incremental coarse-graining step (1,5,10,20, and 30 beads respectively).Each intermediate step has 
two files, both of which are automatically generated by the representation optimizer.\

- `bead map file`: A file containing the list of beads for each protein, domain in the system. Each line corresponds to a single bead and is of the format \
`protein domain start_residue end_residue` \
where start_residue and end_residue are residue start and end numbers for each bead. 

- `bead precisions file`: A file with each line corresponding to a bead in the identical line number in the bead map file. This is of the format\
`protein domain bead_index bead_sampling_precision boolean_whether_representation_and_sampling_precisions_commensurate_for_bead`

Finally, a representative model in the final, optimal representation is shown. 

## tfiih
The TFIIH [folder](tfiih/) contains all modeling and analysis inputs for modeling TFIIH, including component PDB files, crosslinks file, EM map, FASTA file, move sizes for different sized beads, file containing EM anchor points, and so on. See the [TFIIH repository](https://salilab.org/tfiih) and paper for details on these.\
Additionally the folder contains a topology file similar in format to the ones used for the sample binary complexes.
